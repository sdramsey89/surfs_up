# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Project
 - The purpose of of this analysis was to investigate the viability of opening a ice cream and surf shop combo in Hawaii. This initial analysis focused on temperature during the months of June and Decemeber.

## Results
### June
![June Temps](/Resources/june_temps.png)
- The average temperature in June is 74.9 F. The temperature ranges from 64 F to 85 F. 

### December
![December Temps](/Resources/june_temps.png)
- The average temperatrue in December is  71.9 F. The temperature ranges from 56 F to 83 F.

### Major Differences
1. The range in December (27 degrees) is 6 degrees more than in June (21 degrees).
2. Although the max temperatures are relatively close (2 degrees difference) the low temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than June.
3. The standard deviation is .5 larger in December meaning that December has more variance in temperatures which is consistent with its larger temperature range.

## Summary
Based on the results, Hawaii would be a great climate for an ice cream surf shop combo. Looking at both June and December, the temperatures are consistently warm which is ideal for both surfing and eating ice cream. The additional queries below further support this conclusion in that both months are not inundated with rain. December definitely gets more rain but the daily average is still below a quarter of an inch. 

### Additional Queries
Below are queries showing the average precipitation for each month. Looking at precipitation in addition to temperature gives a more complete look at conditions for eating ice cream and surfing. The numbers are relatively low for both months. There is more precipitation in December but it already tends to be a "colder" month.

Additionally, I created visualization of monthly Highs, Lows, and averages for the entire year. This visualization helps to expand the analysis and look at temperature ranges for the entire year.<br>

### Addtiontal Required Analysis
This initial analysis is very limited in scope. Other factors should be researched before opening the shop. Additional questions that should be researched include:
- Wave patterns in Hawaii: A surf shop needs to know where the best location is for catching waves all year long. Several websites collect data not only on wave size but whether or not the conditions
- Competive analysis: Where are all the surf shops and ice cream shops currently located? Are there any combination surf/ice cream shops already?
- Trends: When are ice cream sales lowest and when are surf shops sales lowest? Do these slow periods overlap?
